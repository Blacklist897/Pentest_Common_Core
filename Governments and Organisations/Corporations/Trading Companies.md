## Moonrakers Trading Conglomerate
Headquarters: None

>"Having my latest find appraised turned out to be trickier than I had anticipated, and so my contact suggested reaching out to the Moonrakers. Depending on who you ask they are either the last bastion of freedom or people that would do anything if there's money to be made, and I don't think they themselves agree about which is which. Either way, there's no denying they had the means and expertise."
-"The Unknown and Lesser Known of the Spinward sector", Vedika Bakshi

Back in the late 2100's the Moonrakers Movement started to appear as a grassroots pushback against Terragov's encroaching the off-world markets during the early days of space colonization. It's proponents would preach about the sanctity of the free market and personal freedom while the Terran Federation still struggled to crack down on the flood of contraband amid the foundation of the first space colonies.
The movement's methods would range from lobbying, to acts of defiance, the occasional violent scuffle and even a few bombings, though given the group's unofficial status pinning the blame on anyone but the individuals responsible was difficult. 
Not everyone agrees the movement was as spontaneous as it looked on the surface, some believe the group was backed by several powerful groups from behind the scenes, and although never proven, they certanly were to benefit greatly from it.

This would all but become obvious when the Conglomerate would officially become a corporation off the back of the Martian Revolution in 2280. Originally founded by several high profile trading magnates hoping to win their battle with the power of burocracy, it has since evolved into a massive distribution network of big and small companies.

Their public appearance still clings to their staunchly capitalist ethos of complete freedom from government involvement in the trading business, although they will still begrudgingly abide by Terragov laws to operate in their territories, or at least by anything their army of lawyers think they can get comfortably get away with.
Despite the numerous scandals for their unsavory practices they still remain as successful and popular as ever.

Word is that under the mask of a legitimate corporation the Moonrakers are also a major supplier of black market goods and there's nothing they won't sell to those with the right connections - and for the right price, of course.


## Doubletime Logistics
Headquarters: HKF Somere, Grand Nomad Fleet

>"It's not just FAST, it's Doubletime!"
-Doubletime Company Slogan

It was only natural for the nomad fleet to rent out every inch of free cargo space while on their way to their next destination, but eventually what were once just occasional jobs done out of convenience became a full fledged operation of trading and long distance hauling.

Although they still fall under direct ownership of the admiralty, their influence still allows them an atypical degree of freedom to operate as they see fit, which has made them a somewhat controversial topic among their own. Their position as something of a middleman between the admiralty and the outside world means supply deals tend to go through them first.

Their ability to reliably haul extremely large quantities of cargo is well documented, yet there is much speculation on whether some of the goods they offer for trade are acquired legitimately and even rumors about the company being used as a proxy for mercenary piracy contracts. There's never been evidence of this being a widespread occurrence however, and some of the past incidents have been swept under the rug with claims of involvement by third parties.
