## Moonrakers Trading Conglomerate
Headquarters: None

The Conglomerate was initially founded by several high profile trading magnates dissatisfied with Terragov's encroaching the off-world free market during the early days of space colonization and has since evolved into a massive distribution network of big and small companies.

Their public appearance still clings to their staunchly capitalist ethos of complete freedom from government involvement in the trading business, although they will still begrudgingly abide by Terragov laws to operate in their territories, or at least by anything their army of lawyers think they can get comfortably get away with.
Despite the numerous scandals for their unsavory practices they still remain as successful and popular as ever.

Word is that under the mask of a legitimate corporation the Moonrakers are also a major supplier of black market goods and there's nothing they won't sell to those with the right connections - and for the right price, of course.


## Doubletime Logistics
Headquarters: HKF Somere, Grand Nomad Fleet

It was only natural for the nomad fleet to rent out every inch of free cargo space while on their way to their next destination, but eventually what were once just occasional jobs done out of convenience became a full fledged operation for trading and long distance hauling.

They mainly operate for clients outside of the fleet itself by hauling cargo but also manage much of the trading in and out of the fleet, working as something of a middleman between the admiralty and the outside world when it comes to supply deals.

Although they still fall under the ownership of the admiralty, their influence still allows them an atypical degree of freedom on how to operate which has made them a somewhat controversial topic. 
Their ability to reliably haul extremely large quantities of cargo is well documented, yet there is much speculation on whether some of the goods they offer for trade are acquired legitimately and even rumors about the company being used as a proxy for mercenary piracy contracts. There's never been evidence of this being a widespread occurrence however, and some of the past incidents have been swept under the rug with claims of involvement by third parties.
