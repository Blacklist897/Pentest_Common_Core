# Miscellaneous Culture of the Ethereals

Ethereal culture is particularly odd within the inhabited galaxy- while they had, prior to the Great Enlightenment, a very diverse range of homegrown cultural groups and individual societies, much of their history post-uplifting has been dominated by humanity, and as such, their cultural makeup has become homogenised and subsumed by humanity's. While they may not literally wear humanity's blue jeans and listen to their pop music, the influence of their "protectors" can be seen everywhere in modern Ethereal society. Native languages are dwindling, being replaced by Galactic Common. Traditional religion strains against the influence of human faiths. Long-held traditions are consigned to history. Efforts are being made by some to preserve the Ethereals' distinct history, but it seems in many ways to be a losing battle, as more and more Ethereals make the decision to leave behind their life on Sprout and head out into the great beyond in search of adventure.

Some of these attempts to preserve culture have come in the form of reactionary militias, made up (mostly) of the former warrior and priestly castes of Ethereal society. Wielding strong power and influence in the remote, cut-off hinterlands, these groups provide strong resistance to TerraGov's presence on the planet. While not strong enough nor bold enough to attempt attacks on the regions directly under TerraGov's influence, they are a perpetual threat in the border regions and cause serious problems for construction crews and frontiersmen in these areas. The task of expanding the frontier on Sprout is typically given to corporations via E-Colony charters. Nanotrasen is one of the many corporations involved in this process.

None of this is to say that Ethereals do not have a distinct culture. While the influence of humanity is extreme, they have maintained some elements of their heritage. In particular, Ethereal music remains a defiant area of their culture, particularly as music has major religious and cultural significance to the Ethereals.


### Rule of Nature and the Uplifting Schism

>"Saying that Sprout is a hostile planet wouldn't be exactly correct - Nature has its own plan here. But you and me? We're not part of this equation, the only way to not get hurt is to stay out of the way."
-"The Tourist's Survival Guide to Sprout", Vedika Bakshi

Life on Sprout is full of dangers. Massive creatures, dangerous plants and harsh, unpredictable environments are only a few of the many problems the Ethereals always had to contend with. The countless failed attempts at taming the wilds have given the Ethereals a deep reverence for the environment they live in: it seemed nature was intent on teaching them that the planet was not theirs to conquer, and so they learned to find their place in the ecosystem. 
The Ethereals have mastered a delicate balancing act of carving themselves a safe haven from the encroaching wilderness and maintaining the ecosystem as undisturbed as possible. Settlements vary wildly in size and types based on the environment, ranging from large, more traditional cities built in the plains to small settlements tucked away in the deep forest, built high up in the intricate tree canopies away from most dangers.
This way of living has taught the ethereals how to efficiently harness their environment. Much of their sustenace comes from foraging natural resources rather than traditional farming, and despite its dangers Sprout is a bountiful planet full of resources for those that know how to harvest them in a sustainable manner.

Everything would change after the Uplifting. In no time at all, the ethereals found themselves gifted with the technology they needed to truly conquer the planet. Yet many, even those who are open to this new way of living, still cling to the same respect for nature that they had before, perhaps out of habit or desire to hold onto their history. Some others still fear for the future, and believe all of the destruction wrought by the uplifting was merely a portent of what happens when the natural order of things is broken, and that nature's retaliation will come in time, stronger than ever.


### Tourism

>"These days I spend most of my time making sure tourists don't get eaten by wild animals. Can't digest them, gives them a tummy ache."
-Kepler XVI, Trailwarden

Following the uplifting Sprout became a popular tourist attraction due to it's beautiful and unique environments. From scientists and adventurers to families on vacation and net influencers chasing their new viral story, the gold rush to discover this new and exciting planet seems to never end, with mixed reactions by the locals.
Although this would become a boon to jumpstart Sprout's economy into the intergalactic stage, it put a serious strain on the ethereal society still reeling from the devastation.
Nothing could have cemented the opinion of those still on the fence about the outsiders who nearly destroyed the planet more than seeing dumb tourists litter, destroy and deface day after day while flippantly upsetting the balance that the ethereals struggled to keep for generations.

Nevertheless, many of the unique products originating from Sprout are now quite popular, and the demand seems to keep rising.


### Proxiharp and Resonation Organ

A popular musical instrument in ethereal society, built of two metal semicircles connected together by three metal rods and a wooden case opened on one side. It has been likened to a theremin for the sound it produces and principles by which it functions, except powered by the electromagnetic field of the ethereals themselves, using hand gestures in front of the exposed rods to modulate sound. As such, this instrument can't normally be played by non-ethereals. Replicas with their own power source do exist, though experts would argue they sound nothing alike.

Another instrument using the same principle, the Resonation Organ, consists of a circular wooden platform usually about 3 meters wide, with 5 metal rods emerging from the base around the edges. They are often placed in town squares, easily found by listening to the music echoing through the city streets at every hour of the day.
Unlike Proxiharps, Resonation Organ are played using the entire body rather than just the hands.
"Resodancers", those who master the Resonation Organs, bring their art to the next level with a seamless fusion of dazzling dancing and music playing. Not many can manage such a feat and such individuals often become celebrities in their community.
Top level Resodancers may wear adorned full body robes lined with metal wires that covers them head to toe to block their own electromagnetic field. An array of laces around their limbs that they can loose or tighten allows them to free parts of their bodies as needed to compose their music.


### Glowbark Statues

A favored souvenir by tourists, Glowbark Statues are often mistaken as glowing rocks but are in fact round mushrooms with a hard, barky dark grey exterior carved into different shapes revealing their glowing interior, like an all-in-one jack'o'lantern. Unfortunately for tourists that don't know any better, Glowbarks continue growing even after being carved and what was once a beautifully crafted statue will eventually grow back into a round rock without regular maintenance.

In ethereal culture, glowbarks are often used as decorations or markers, and carving them is a popular hobby to pass the time. It's not uncommon to see piles of carved glowbarks placed around town entrances or social gathering spots, collected and maintained by the entire community over the years.

Most glowbarks typically reach sizes of about 20 centimeters, although they never stop growing and given enough time and maintenance they can reach about 2 to 3 meters. Some of such statues are displayed in city centers and maintained over many years by trusted artists.


### Trailwardens

>"My duty is to defend my land and my people first and foremost. But as long as you're under my guidance, and listen to what I say, I will give my life to protect you, if that's what it takes."
-Kepler XVI, Trailwarden

One of the most respected roles among the working classes, Trailwardens fill many roles in the defence of their settlement: though they are warriors, Trailwarden duties rarely require fighting and usually involve maintaining the roads and proximity of their settlement safe by keeping tabs on local wildlife, repairing infrastructure such as bridges and fences and guiding travelers across particularly dangerous trails, should any other method to better secure the roads be impossible.
Their tasks and the number of appointed trailwardens grealy varies depending on the needs of each settlement. Small villages tend to only have a single trailwarden, while in bigger settlements they may have more of a managerial role, coordinating the efforts of entire teams assigned to different tasks.

Many myths and legends surround trailwardens, and stories of their deeds, some more real than others, are often shared around campfires.
One such popular myth tells of the founder of the trailwarden guild founder who would ride atop a Crystal Dweller in defence of their village against an entire army.

Trailwarden equipment can vary wildly depending on their needs and environment. Although most favor the bow as a weapon, no trailwarden worth the name would be found without a sling, which they often keep wrapped around their wrist. Some would deride using such a primitive weapon, but the sling's real value is not that of a weapon but a survival tool being used to knock fruit off of trees, scare off wildlife or hunt small game, all the while adding no extra weight to be carried on long trips.
Slinging also happens to be a rather popular passtime thanks to the reverence towards Trailwardens among young ethereals, so many are often already somewhat proficient at using one.
